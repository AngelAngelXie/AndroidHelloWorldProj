# Android Prework - *Android Hello World Project*

Submitted by: **JiaXin Angel Xie**

**Hello World** is an android app that shows an image and introductory message, and allows pressing a button to display a Toast. I also added additional features that enable users to input their name. The name will then be used to generate a greeting message.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Image and introductory message displayed on screen
* [x] Button displayed on screen
* [x] Toast with message appears when button is pressed 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] include a gradient background
* [x] change the shape of the image and add an image border
* [x] change the shape and color of buttons
* [x] change text font and establish a clear size/color hierarchy for headline, title, and body.
* [x] organize and establish reasonable spacing of elements
* [x] all elements are centered with reasonable constraints
* [x] create input bar using EditText to collect user's name
* [x] create a functional submit button. Upon clicking, a greeting message is generated using the user's name
* [x] modify the color of the Android status bar on top

## Notes

During the process, I encountered many difficulties in organizing the elements and polishing the final results with aesthetic features. For example, I spent a lot of time googling and learning about how to ensure reasonable spacing between elements. I also learned to personalize the app by figuring out how to modify the properties of buttons and texts. Through the process of researching, I also learn to organize the code by creating files in specific folders for easy access. 
Another difficulty I encountered is in debugging. There are many instances where I must google to understand error messages and look through a large amount of code to resolve issues in the program. This helped me get familiar with error messages in android studio.
